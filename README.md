# Animal Shelter

## Record of housed animals

The application will be used by the employees of a shelter,
in order to keep records of the animals that they are housing.
They will be able to register new animals (specifying their characteristics),
unregister them when they are adopted, log medical conditions,
and produce a week's schedule for a given animal including:
-  feeding times
-  outdoor/exercise time
-  medications

This project is of interest to me because I have recently started 
volunteering at a vet clinic (I'm bored from COVID and miss my dog),
and I thought it would be a good system to try to imitate. This is because
I am somewhat aware of the necessary functionality of the system, as well
as its applicability to the real world.

## User Stories

- as a user, I want to be able to register a new animal to the shelter,
specifying its characteristics
- as a user, I want to be able to unregister an animal once they are adopted
- as a user, I want to be able to log medical conditions, and necessary medications
- as a user, I want to be able to select an animal and view it in detail
- as a user, I want to be able to save my animal shelter to file
- as a user, I want to be able to load my animal shelter from file

## Phase 4: Task 2
I decided to test and implement one of my classes so that it is robust.
The class that I chose to make robust was the AnimalShelter.java class, specifically its
methods registerAnimal() and adoptAnimal(), because these are the only ones that have a 
requires clause.
