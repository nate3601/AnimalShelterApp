# Animal Shelter

## Record of housed animals

The application will be used by the employees of a shelter,
in order to keep records of the animals that they are housing.
They will be able to register new animals (specifying their characteristics),
unregister them when they are adopted, log medical conditions,
and produce a week's schedule for a given animal including:
-  feeding times
-  outdoor/exercise time
-  medications

This project is of interest to me because I have recently started 
volunteering at a vet clinic (I'm bored from COVID and miss my dog),
and I thought it would be a good system to try to imitate. This is because
I am somewhat aware of the necessary functionality of the system, as well
as its applicability to the real world.
